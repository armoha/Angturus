The incantation for the All-Seeing Eye spell is "I summon the All-Seeing Eye to tear a hole into the sky. Reveal to me that which is hidden. Unveil to me what is forbidden."
'안 봐도 보이는 눈'이여 떠라
구멍을 찢고 하늘로 올라가서
숨겨진 것을 나에게 허락해
금지된 것을 환하게 밝혀주거라
The incantation for Moon's "darkest spell" is "I call the darkness unto me from deepest depths of Earth and sea. From ancient evils unawoken, break the one that can't be broken. To blackest night, I pledge my soul and crush my heart to burning coal. To summon forth a deathly power, to see my hated foe devoured."

    The incantation is slightly different in "Toffee than in "Moon the Undaunted": "I call the darkness unto me from deepest depths of Earth and sea. From ancient evils unawoken, break the one who can't be broken. From blackest night, I pledge my soul and crush my heart to burning coal. To summon forth a deadly power, to see my hated foe devoured."
